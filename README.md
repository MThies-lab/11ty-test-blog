Static Site generation test, Type: blog

This blog is a test to experiment with static site generation. 
For the purposes of this experiment I am including an off-the-cuff review of the song that just came up on my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist. 

Not to brag, but openly rejecting humility, I'm a fan of the blues and try to make down to the shipyard every Tuesday night to a local shotgun blues bar that dates back to World War 2 and a time when the only thing a bar needed to stock was Schiltz beer, Seagrams No.7 Whiskey, Ginger Ale, and Lucky Strike cigarettes. 
The point of all this being that the opening licks come smoking up from the pavement, just like any night you roll up to the Rusty Nail, and those languid misty guitar trills and pocket drumming turn your night into a movie scene and soundtrack determined. 
It sounds like Chicago, it sounds liike B.B. King, it sounds like Sam Cooke, it sounds like Motown after dark when they let the troubles, the longings, the fervors, lusts, and thirsts crawl out of the night into your chest. The room is dark, and the singer, a fiery, slim white woman named Enlly Blue, opens her mouth and a great plains tornado whips out, raspy, crackling with gusto, chuztpah, with old school attitude. Sure enough, there's something supernatural about her voice, a storm more than woman, somehow wrangled inside a mortal coil. Compared to modern singers, draw a trinagle with Lizzo, Grace Potter, and an early Reba McEntire and you know what jetstream Enlly Blue is riding across the airwaves.

That's the impression that "Keep on Boogiin' " will leave you with as you're sifting through a swamp of how to set up git hub pages and static site generators, and somehow, it helps. Sometime it's important to remember that grooves exist for a reason, and that finding the right one is the best way to get on track.
